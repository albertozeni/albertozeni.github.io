I am currently a Ph.D. [Student at Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) at [NECSTLab](https://necst.it/) working on Genome Analysis and High Performance Computing. 

My research concentrates on the development and acceleration of genome analysis algorithms. 
I focus on analyzing current bottlenecks in various genome pipelines and developing new solutions that can reduce the time required for the analysis. 
To this end, I am developing solutions on FPGA or GPU architectures, depending on which is most suited for the task, and providing drop-in replacements for state-of-the-art software solutions.

My doctorate aims to provide a fully hardware-accelerated genomic pipeline exploiting the best heterogeneous architecture for every step, enabling the analysis of genomes order of magnitudes faster with respect to the available software solutions.

A recent **[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C7hanhxteAFYGRof6i-0_vI6FEXx5o1F/view?usp=sharing)**.

The best way to contact me is by **email**: alberto.zeni@polimi.it

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
